# Born-2-be-root_42Project
Born2beroot is the first System Administration project on the 42-curriculum.

This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.
You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you can’t use VirtualBox)
under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up
your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

On this project you'll learn how to set up your own server and you should be comfortable with virtualization, set up a security policy, manage users, have a background about 
fire-walls, SSH, package manager, be familaire with command line, partitioning memory with LVM, as well as take an introduction to Bash to wirte a script and run it periodically.

# Mandatory part : 

This project consists of having you set up your first server by following specific rules

Since it is a matter of setting up a server, you will install the
minimum of services. For this reason, a graphical interface is of no
use here. It is therefore forbidden to install X.org or any other
equivalent graphics server.

-> Create LVM partitions to our new VM OS.

-> Installing SSH and configuring SSH service

-> Installing and configuring UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

-> Set password policy

-> Set-up a strong configuration for the sudo group

-> Finally, you have to create a simple script called monitoring.sh  display some information on all terminals every 10 minutes. It must be developed in bash

# Bonus part :

• Set up a functional WordPress website with the following services: lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP.

• Set up a service of your choice that you think is useful (NGINX / Apache2 excluded!). During the defense, you will have to justify your choice.
